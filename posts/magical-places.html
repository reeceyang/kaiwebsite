      <h2>magical places</h2>
      <span class="post-date">June 12, 2023</span>
      <div class="content">
      <p>Two days ago, I embarked on my journey to Santa Fe, where I will be working for the summer. My mom drove me and my brother from Los Angeles.</p><p>We drove for five hours to Wickenburg, Arizona first, where an old family friend resides. We planned to stay with him for the night before driving on to Santa Fe.</p><p>In the car, I read <em>The Priory of the Orange Tree</em>, a very thick book that has dragons in it. I kept taking breaks to turn over the characters and events in my mind, so I only read up to page 100 that day. I hardly ever read high fantasy, so I’m interested in how the rest of the book will turn out.</p><p>The road to Arizona was first nestled within golden-green Californian hills; then it was flat and sandy for a long time. As we broke into Arizona, the surrounding land became studded with tall, girthy saguaros, springing out of the ground in convoluted green nodes. All manner of cactus began sprouting before my eyes. Stout, purple fellows; bunches of spiked flippers; thin, fuzzy antennae.</p><p>We arrived in Wickenburg, which boasted even more of a variety of cacti. A sign read QUAIL RUN VILLAGE. Three brightly colored quails were painted underneath the lettering.</p><p>A few minutes later, I was shocked to see that there really were quails running about, fat black feathers bobbing atop their heads. “Womp,” they cried in high-pitched voices every minute or so. “Womp!”</p><p>This friend in Wickenburg has a large backyard garden, which is filled with fruit trees and vegetables of all sorts: celery, onions, carrots, even a grapevine snaking along the back fence. He harvests this food to eat, and often even ends up with too much for himself.</p><p>I stood in this garden for a long time. Lizards scuttled to and fro. Some were muscled, sand-colored bearded dragons. Some were sleek, black lizards sliding across the ground. I poked my brother and told him, “Look at that bird with the red head, on the large cactus.” What a beautiful sentence! When I sent photos to my partner, she mused, “Arizona is a magical place.” I felt this as well.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wh6p!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9f137446-e9b1-41ba-8630-85c529a7d437_2048x1536.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wh6p!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9f137446-e9b1-41ba-8630-85c529a7d437_2048x1536.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wh6p!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9f137446-e9b1-41ba-8630-85c529a7d437_2048x1536.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wh6p!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9f137446-e9b1-41ba-8630-85c529a7d437_2048x1536.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wh6p!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9f137446-e9b1-41ba-8630-85c529a7d437_2048x1536.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9f137446-e9b1-41ba-8630-85c529a7d437_2048x1536.jpeg" width="1456" height="1092" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9f137446-e9b1-41ba-8630-85c529a7d437_2048x1536.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1092,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;No description available.&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="No description available." title="No description available." srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wh6p!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9f137446-e9b1-41ba-8630-85c529a7d437_2048x1536.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wh6p!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9f137446-e9b1-41ba-8630-85c529a7d437_2048x1536.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wh6p!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9f137446-e9b1-41ba-8630-85c529a7d437_2048x1536.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wh6p!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9f137446-e9b1-41ba-8630-85c529a7d437_2048x1536.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image"><svg role="img" style="height:20px;width:20px" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="var(--color-fg-primary)" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><g><title></title><path d="M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882"></path></g></svg></button><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>The next day, we drove the remaining seven hours to Santa Fe. Gradually, we became surrounded by adobe houses, painting the horizon in shades of orange and pink. It turned out that the Airbnb where I was staying was also an adobe house, the ceiling supported by logs. All the furniture had a very rustic feel. I put a mat down on the ground at the foot of the bed and then laid a blanket over it. This would be my bed for the summer, since I was splitting the house with one other person, and I’d insisted they sleep on the actual bed so I’d have a chance to try out floor sleeping.</p><p>After unpacking, I went out and got a library card (and checked out a book, so that I’d be forced to return to the library); bought groceries; and bought a new swimsuit for this summer, since my old one is becoming very loose.</p><p>I swam first thing this morning, which felt wonderful after a month or so of not swimming at all—first because of finals, then because I didn’t have access to an adequate pool. Then I visited the New Mexico History Museum, where I learned that much of the early population growth in New Mexico after it became a state stemmed from a chain of hotels owned by Fred Harvey. He employed exclusively young, single women to staff the restaurants, attracting men from all over the country to New Mexico to find wives and settle down with them. It was like an early Hooters.</p><p>We went to a Chinese restaurant afterwards. I ordered a tomato and egg noodle soup. While eating, I saw a man with a giant blue macaw on his shoulder enter the restaurant. Next to me, my brother spluttered and pointed at him. The man noticed this and smiled and said hi to my brother. The blue macaw also looked at my brother and said, “Hi.”</p><p>Soon the man and the blue macaw sat down at a table outside the restaurant. He had a big bowl of noodles and a little plate next to it. He scooped noodles onto the plate, and the macaw hopped down from his shoulder to slurp up the noodles. I was awestruck.</p><p>Santa Feans seem to have a wonderful appreciation for birds. We walked around the Plaza after meeting the macaw, and each market had bird merchandise of all sorts: long birds, round birds, colorful birds, severe-looking birds. Each market also had a large, fluffy stuffed llama for sale, displayed without fail at the front door.</p><p>After this, we went to the New Mexico Museum of Art. Most of the museum was only mildly enjoyable to look at, but there was a whole section dedicated to glass art, which blew my mind. MIT has a glass-blowing class and displays their creations in the basement, so I thought I’d pretty much seen the range of what you could do with glass, but I was so wrong. Here, glass was stretched and molded into impossibly fluid and detailed shapes. Many of the pieces didn’t even look like glass—they were tinted and textured so that instead, they resembled jade or amethyst or bone. Some guy had molded glass into the shape of his penis and then painted it with a reflective silver substance, so you could watch your reflection warp around all the parts comprising his appendage.</p><p>We passed by a tour while exiting the museum. The tour guide, Lee, was saying that in Santa Fe, a town of around 80,000 people, there were over 200 art galleries, and apparently this was a really good figure. I mean, for every 400 people, there was one running an art gallery. I guess that’s a lot of successful artists. Lee introduced himself as an artist, a black-and-white photographer. “I have my own darkroom,” he added. </p><p>After all of this, I went back to my casita, drank chamomile tea, and thought about making dinner.
