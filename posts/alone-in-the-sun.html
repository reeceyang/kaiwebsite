      <h2>alone in the sun</h2>
      <span class="post-date">June 11, 2025</span>
      <div class="content">
      <p>I get ten hours of daylight. It’s a strange feeling to step out of my office and come face-to-face with the bright teal facade of the students’ building, to turn the corner and have the sea in my sight and filling my throat, to see surfers tugging their wetsuits down in the crevice of their car door, all while people shuffle around me with hoods pulled over their heads, scarves clutched to their chests against the wind. It’s not really so cold or windy. 50F and an ocean breeze. But the whole place, you can tell, is built for the sun: the windows don’t close; the buildings have AC but no heating; homes have washers but not dryers. For as far south as I am, the winter is just mild enough—tamped by the warm Mozambique current; shielded by a curved peninsula from the cold Benguela opposite—that for nine out of twelve months you can pretend summer is forever. Even when I hear rain thundering on the roof I feel the itch to open my balcony door and let the air in, and the ocean, and the sun.</p><p>Finally this weekend I gave up on waiting for the rain to let up and walked down to the beach, barefoot, to run. I have this dream of being jacked in a poorly defined “natural” way—like, running a six-minute mile, being able to maneuver my body into any configuration, having this vague sense of self-sufficiency. In Cambridge all my exercise happened inside one gym or another. My sessions smelled like alcohol wipes and were split by muscle group and punctuated by going on my phone to text my friends. Now I’d have to take an Uber into town for an indoor gym.</p><p>Here are the things people tell me about Cape Town: that their friends got robbed at knifepoint on <em>their</em> summer internships here, that I shouldn’t take the train, that I shouldn’t look at my phone while walking, that I shouldn’t go to the food market alone, that I shouldn’t go hiking alone, that basically I should stay in a crowd or stay at home. Every building I enter has a different key for each entrance and at least two locked doors between the street and any given room and a fenced perimeter topped with rusted, barbed wire; around half the establishments plaster a sign saying ARMED RESPONSE SYSTEM to the front door. When I was searching for running paths the neighborhood improvement website warned me that joggers often get mugged, especially on the paved paths by the beach that cut under the train tracks, and that if I planned to jog the mountain I should “carry a baton or stick for protection”. Reddit informed me that actually as long as I’m fast enough any running path is safe.</p><p>When I decided to go run on the beach, I hadn’t yet figured out what would and wouldn’t get stolen, but I’d seen surfers walking up this path in just a wetsuit, no shoes, holding their boards, so I assumed leaving my sandals loose on the beach was not the move. That’s why I was barefoot, and why later, on the return trip, drenched and with toes irritated from repeated impact on the sand, I had to walk slowly, wincing at gravel cutting into the soles of my feet.</p><p>That night I watched the ocean in the darkness, from the balcony of a restaurant where I was waiting to see a jazz performance. I had come alone, and there was nothing else for me to do before the set started but to look out, squinting against the wind and mist, onto the street, at the group of teenagers huddled together and hunching over to light one another’s cigarettes; the parking lot attendant in a neon vest holding his phone speaker to his ear and dancing in small, jerky motions; the sea, which absent illumination from the clouded sky presented as a black expanse upon which white lines of foam bloomed horizontally as they approached the shore and then withered.</p><p>Though I’d been assured of the lead keyboardist Andile Yenana’s “legendary” quality when buying the ticket, nothing could have prepared me for his actual person. The only one performing who looked a day over thirty, he spoke softly into a microphone while the trumpet player next to him continually readjusted its placement, producing low-frequency shuffling noises that reverberated through the mic and made Andile’s voice sound as though he were speaking underwater. The other four musicians—trumpet, trombone, bass, drums—wore brightly patterned jackets and had their hair in beanies, except for the trumpet player, who wore waist-length dreads. Andile had on a black hair net and a white linen shirt. He handled the keyboard, I swear, like driving a knife through soft butter, that smooth and fast and easy. I was sitting behind him and could trace his hands as they did not so much jump between keys as they simply held the keyboard in the right places, pressed rapid notes with languid ease. When each of the rest of the players paused after their improv sections they leaned back against the wall or slouched into their seats and watched Andile and smiled.</p><p>Between pieces he would look around at us and shake his head and laugh. “I wrote this in 1994,” he said, to introduce his next song, “living in a flat in Rwanda. Back then we—everyone I knew—we were all trying to change the country. We didn’t realize the same thing was happening all across Africa.”</p><div><hr></div><p>I have lunch each day from the canteen of that bright teal-colored building where the students live and take lessons. I sit with faculty, but the school is so small that all the students know all the faculty, so there are always a couple of students sitting with us. Inevitably we get to chatting about their goals once they return to their home countries: to start a computer vision research lab in Benin; to found a company to bring AI to businesses in Cameroon. It makes me feel a bit embarrassed, faced with their earnestness and the way they take their dreams so seriously, to then admit I have none of my own. I feel the need to justify it—to say, once I did have a dream, one I took very seriously, but then I lost it; to say, I’m searching for a dream now. I don’t say this, though. It’s holding on to the dream, preserving it against the hard winds of the world, that is difficult, that they’ve done and I haven’t.</p><p>I realize I’m thinking too much all about myself again. There’s the paradox that in being self-critical I am actually being self-centered, expending my energy on scrubbing at an image of myself. I know the people I admire the most are the people whose dreams are for the world, who don’t spend so much time thinking about how they’re perceived or how to approach their own lives beyond some pretty basic principles. I know the way to get there is to be open and attentive and to trust people will do the same in kind.</p><p>But often all I want is to be alone. To not have to contort my presence around another’s. Trying to hold conversations in the din of the canteen, having them repeat themselves over and over, thinking <em>they must think I’m really stupid</em>. Making a potential faux pas over email every time I talk to this collaborator. Mishearing people and realizing whole minutes later that I had straight up lied to them. </p><p>Strung tight and nauseated, I left work early today (no one else had come to the office anyway), brought my sandals to the beach this time and buried them in the sand so they wouldn’t be stolen. The sun had long passed its zenith; only half its face showed from behind the mountain. </p><p>I waded through the water, diving under breaking waves, to escape the mountain’s growing shadow. I had thought about swimming properly, but the choppy, brown waves kept breaking in a churning white all the way to the horizon, nothing like the sharp green lustre I’d observed on my previous run, when the sea had also of course been saturated with surfers. Anyway a black flag was raised that signified poor visibility for sharkspotting, and bluebottles littered the sand, and the sun was setting and no one else was around, so I was being stupid already, but it did make me feel more relaxed, being by myself in cold water. Birds dove under the golden tides. Shellfish dragged their bodies toward the ocean, leaving faint imprints on the shore.</p><p>When only a quarter of the sun still showed, I headed back to retrieve my sandals. I realized I had failed to locate their burial point relative to any landmark and spent a few minutes shuffling along the shore kicking at plausible-looking piles of sand.</p><p>Someone whistled at me and I looked up. It was a man wrapped in a towel squatting in a bush. “There,” he said, pointing. “Where you left them earlier. I saw you.”</p><p>I started laughing and told him thank you. Then I went and dug up the sandals.</p><div><hr></div><p>I like having a big, comfortable bedroom. I like my short walk to the office in silence. I like controlling what I eat. I hate eating berries alone, with clean hands, out of a bowl that I fill myself, with no external input on the proportion of cherries v. raspberries v. grapes. If I were in Cambridge I’d put more berries in the bowl than I thought I’d eat by myself, probably lean on the side of more cherries since my friends are the kind of people to relish spitting out the pits, and after I washed them I bet people would slink up and point and say, Can I have some? as if their presence wasn’t what made me think to get berries in the first place. </p><p>When I ran past Longfellow Bridge on one of the last nights before leaving Cambridge I turned around and watched the ribs of the bridge light up from inside. There stretched the skyline I’d spent four years tracing against evening light. With a feeling of great relief, I thought of the next week when I would be across the Atlantic and all alone.</p>
