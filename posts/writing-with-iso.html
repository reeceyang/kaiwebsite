      <h2>writing to Iso</h2>
      <span class="post-date">June 05, 2023</span>
      <div class="content">
      <p>In my junior year of high school, I had this intense parasocial relationship with my English teacher. I’m not going to use his real name because he is pretty big in the poetry world, so you could just look him up and tell him I’ve written this weird, creepy blog about him. If he ever happens to see this and recognizes himself in it, though, I think he’d understand—not my feelings, exactly, but the fact that I had to write about it. I’m going to call him Iso.</p><p>The big thing about Iso that caught my attention was the fact that he had standards for his students. This distinguished him from any schoolteacher I’d ever had, but <em>especially</em> any English teacher—what the rest of them seemed to consider worthy of high praise was twenty-five subject-predicate pairs stacked indiscriminately into five paragraphs. Iso wasn’t like that. He thought we could all write well, and he didn’t lower his standards for anyone. He was also <em>passionate</em> about writing; his class was the first time I saw what someone who thought deeply about literature and poetry could look like.</p><p>Iso’s class was also where I learned to read poetry. He gave us Walt Whitman’s <em>Leaves of Grass</em> first. “The thing about Whitman,” he said, standing at the front of the class in his black T-shirt and jeans, nearly breaking the book’s spine with how he was folding it in his hand, “is that you can’t <em>not</em> get what he’s trying to say, because he just keeps saying it.” Iso was right. Whitman was possibly the best introduction to poetry I could have asked for, as someone staunchly opposed to any kind of writing you had to be literary and intellectual to “get”. </p><p>Then he showed us Emily Dickinson, and after Whitman, I had more patience for her. She understood something about life and death that I had been trying to wrap my brain around for a long time. I didn’t really “get” her poetry on an intellectual level, but it stirred up something in me that I felt pretty sure was the correct thing to be stirred.</p><div><hr></div><p>I looked up Iso’s name one day and found that he was an award-winning poet and novelist. Then I read his biographical sketch, which was available online because he was an award-winning poet and novelist. Iso was half Asian and half white. His white father had left him to be raised by his mother in California, where he had a “rough upbringing” with an abusive uncle, but a deep love for the city and for writing. I felt a deep sense of kinship towards him. Swap the uncle for my stepdad and you had a passable transcript of my life.</p><p>Except saying that was a discredit to Iso’s relationship with our city in California. I’d moved here a few years ago; I loved it, I had deep feelings about it, but not how he did. I couldn’t claim the city we lived in as my own. And I couldn’t tell him any of this, for a few reasons. In fact, I hardly talked with him at all.</p><p>One small reason was that it would’ve been weird to bring this stuff up. One big reason was that in high school I just let people talk to me, and listened. An even bigger reason was that junior year was when I started having nightmares, bad. It felt wrong, like a delayed bomb, because it’d been months since anything bad happened with my stepdad—he mostly stayed out of the house now—but of course this was when the dreams had to start. First, I dreamed about my stepdad raping and killing me, and then it just progressed to <em>anyone</em>. Random guys from school. My best friends. My biological parents. And, of course, most disturbingly, Iso.</p><p>For the most part, one-off dreams like that didn’t affect my relationships with anyone. But it became so persistent with Iso that it affected how I saw him. I’d sit there in class and he’d be talking and I would think about him ramming his fingers into me, not in a desirous way but as an impulsive cognitive stim, and then immediately feel disgusted with myself. </p><p>The biggest reason of all was that I was aware I thought of Iso as a father figure, and this made me extremely uncomfortable, more so than all the other reasons combined.</p><div><hr></div><p>Anyway, I didn’t tell anyone about these things. They made me feel sad and sick. So did Iso’s assigned readings, which, for a good portion of the year, were personal essays written by authors like Carmen Maria Machado and Joan Didion. They were all about family and identity and memory, things that made a hollow, deep pit open up inside me.</p><p>Still, our shared backgrounds and Iso’s love for writing made it feel like he was the only person who could understand me. Not through speech, where I couldn’t express myself adequately even to my closest friends, but through writing. I’d never met anyone else I believed could see through my writing to my person.</p><p>Iso assigned essays and I wrote them with ferocity: pages about where I came from and what home meant to me, about being queer, about writing itself. It was interesting that in trying to get myself across to Iso, I didn’t feel the urge to censor or modify anything. I didn’t know if he would like what I wrote, but I knew he would understand my need to be honest, my hunger to capture the truth. Writing, to me, was more precious than spoken word. If I lied in my writing, then I was lying to myself most of all.</p><div><hr></div><p>I never got to know what Iso thought of me beyond his impersonal, scribbled grading in black pen (usually high marks, sometimes an embellishing adjective), but maybe if he saw me now, he wouldn’t be impressed to see someone trading writing for elitist, upper-class-graduate-student pursuits like mathematics and bouldering. Someone who accepted an internship at the very place Iso cursed out in class, where he showed us an essay about how their nuclear testing fucked up the lives and family lines of thousands. Someone who gave up on ever seeing the heart of our brutal, lonely city. </p><p>So much of me was left in that city when I boarded the flight to Boston. Potentially even earlier; those parts of me began to be wrung out when I moved away during COVID, off to a pleasant, sanitized suburb of Texas where I looked away from all the deaths and riots and loss happening on the west coast. There, I forgot my Spanish; I forgot the slow grip I’d found on the city, on a place to call home; and I forgot some sort of essential grit, some moral tenacity that came with having a people to be part of.</p><p>I think sometimes about finding Iso—it wouldn’t be hard—knocking on his door and dropping off a manuscript or something, asking him to read it, to see into me one last time, how no one ever has. But I think I couldn’t face him how I am now, unmarred by any real challenge, still a child, really. And then I think I’ll always feel like that.</p>
