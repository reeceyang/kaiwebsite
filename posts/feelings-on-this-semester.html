      <h2>feelings on this semester</h2>
      <span class="post-date">November 12, 2022</span>
      <div class="content">
      <h2>classes</h2><p>This semester I’m taking 52 units:</p><p><strong>18.701 (Algebra 1, 12 units)</strong></p><p>This class mainly goes over group theory and linear algebra, neither of which I have much background in. So it’s definitely the class I pour the most time into on a weekly basis. Sometimes I’m not even sure if I’m very interested in the material, but I love the feeling of being challenged by this class and having to think in new, creative ways. Every pset, usually consisting of 8-11 problems, feels like a process of discovery. High school was the last time that I felt this sort of frustration over trying to understand a subject, and it’s exhilarating to experience it again.</p><p><strong>18.353 (Nonlinear Dynamics: Chaos, 12 units)</strong></p><p>This class has been really chill thus far. It’s three hours of lecture and only around three hours of homework a week, but I feel like I’m learning a lot. In particular, I’m <em>so</em> excited for the final project for this class—I plan to analyze the nonlinear dynamics of memristors and will probably blog about it when that happens!</p><p><strong>21G.113 (Streamlined Chinese V, 12 units)</strong></p><p>This is a super fun class! The Streamlined Chinese classes are targeted at students who spoke Chinese growing up, so we spend classes just having discussions in Chinese. My Chinese speaking, reading, and writing abilities have all improved a lot through the class, and speaking Chinese with people outside my family feels entirely different—it’s great to begin speaking it in a more casual and varied context.</p><p><strong>21G.192 (Modern Chinese Fiction and Cinema, 13 units)</strong></p><p>This is the second and final CI-H that I am required to take. It’s 13 units because I’m taking the version that counts toward a Chinese minor, which has an additional translation project on top of the other work for the class.</p><p>This might be my favorite class of the semester. It focuses on Chinese fiction and cinema throughout the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century; I’ve also learned a lot about the historical context behind the media we’ve studied. Some of the history has been very hard to stomach; China has had a particularly violent century—we’ve learned and read about the Japanese invasion of China, the Cultural Revolution, the Tiananmen protests. But I love learning in so much depth the history of a country that I’ve only heard in brashly generalized snippets before; I love studying literature and cinema and connecting it to culture. The weekly readings and movies take me a lot of time to get through, but they’re well worth it for all I’ve gained.</p><p><strong>8.s998 (Physics Mentorship and Pedagogy, 3 units)</strong></p><p>I’m a physics mentor for three first-year students (one taking 8.012, one taking 8.01, one taking 8.01L) this semester. I help them with their psets and provide general support on a weekly basis, and I get paid a stipend for this. I also have to take a pedagogy class, which is very chill and fun; I’ve learned quite a bit about formalizing some intuition that I already had about effective teaching and learning methods.</p><p>The real highlight, of course, is interacting with my mentees. Being able to contribute to their experiences at MIT—making it easier on them, and also guiding them through difficult choices, and watching them grow in their classes—has been wonderful. I might not do this again in future semesters because having weekly meetings still really stresses me out and makes me anxious, but it’s definitely been worth doing this semester.</p><p>At the beginning of the semester, I had registered for 64 units—the courseload above, plus 8.033 (Relativity). But as the term progressed, I found that I was utterly uninterested in what 8.033 had to offer. We spent a month learning special relativity and then a month essentially just going over tensor notation, and by then I was so frustrated with spending several hours a week on tensor algebra that I didn’t care about, I decided to drop the class.</p><p>It was my first time dropping a class, and a bit of an ego hit. I’m now taking less units than I ever have at MIT, yet I feel much more challenged by the classes I <em>am</em> taking (mostly 18.701 tbh). I don’t know if this is a fulfilling or demotivating experience yet, but it’s definitely the first time that a class at MIT has pushed my limits like 18.701 has.</p><h2>not classes</h2><p>In addition to my classes, I joined a new club this semester—<strong>Arcturus!</strong> It’s an engineering team working on building an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) and an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). I’m on the electrical engineering subteam for Ship Happens, the ASV they brought to competition last year (which was also the founding year of Arcturus as an MIT club). So far, I’ve helped to CAD the layout of the box we’ll keep all our electrical components in, decided the motor driver layout, and am now working on a schematic and PCB design for the board with all our motor drivers. I’m learning a lot, and I’m really happy about this—electrical engineering has been something I’ve wanted to become more involved in for a long time. I enjoyed learning about circuits in high school—it was one of my favorite parts of physics—and now I’m building them!</p><p>I’m continuing my <strong>UROP</strong> from previous semesters, though I think this is the last semester that I’ll be involved. I work on theoretical/computational plasma physics and my current project looks at turbulence and electron heating in kinetic plasmas. I spent a week this semester at a conference in Spokane, WA to present about our preliminary findings, and this conference really helped me regain my faith in myself as a potential scientist.</p><div><hr></div><p>Now that I’m a sophomore and can’t use the excuse that I’m “figuring out college” anymore, I have been thinking a lot more about what I actually want to do in the future. I think this semester has helped me explore some ideas I hadn’t seriously considered before—engineering, mentoring, math—but I still feel unfulfilled.</p><p>On the one hand, it's unhealthy to constantly compare myself against others who do have their shit together (at least on the surface). But on the other hand, I can't help but feel that something has to change; I don't want to constantly feel like I'm not doing enough because I don't know what to do. I want to feel like a productive member of society, like I'm doing something that matters and that I can be proud of.</p><p>In high school, it was easy to know what I wanted to do. I didn’t have the resources or opportunities or skillset to make a big difference in the world, so I treated my high school activities as preparation for the future. Mainly through science competitions, I had a rigid, externally defined goal that I could work towards. The steps toward improvement were difficult, but they were <em>clear</em>, and I think that’s what is making me feel lost right now: I don’t even know what I want to work on. And I don’t know where to start figuring it out.</p>
