      <h2>Time or vertigo</h2>
      <span class="post-date">September 07, 2025</span>
      <div class="content">
      <p>One of the few moments in life when I felt time passing. I looked up, suddenly dizzy. Walking home in the dark clutching my packages to my side. Paper bags containing a plastic wheel of nuts; a pair of silk elephant-patterned pants; Annie Ernaux’s <em>Getting Lost</em> printed on creamy paper so thick I kept thumbing at the edge when turning the page convinced I was skipping over one. <em>Getting Lost </em>is the unedited diary of her affair in Paris with a younger man. In the diary she is nearing fifty, and somehow victim to the same fugue state of desire as myself at 21.</p><p>I was walking home from getting dinner with Olivia and Rachel at this Cuban seaside bar. Outside the glass sliding doors, a balcony jutted over the fishermen’s wharf. I went out, snapped photos of the bay, of little boats painted dark reds and blues. I tried to take a picture of myself because my hair looked good. My face was still swollen with salt from surfing earlier and I felt self conscious angling a phone around while the entire rest of the restaurant ate dinner. Soon I gave up and went back inside. This place had chandeliers hanging from the ceiling, and dark earthy wooden floors and walls punctuated by flashes from bottles of gin or waiters’ golden belts. The faint scent of incense wafted from a group of people draped in smoke close to the bar.</p><p>I was a few weeks deep into a bout of despair, here in gorgeous Cape Town thousands of miles from anyone I loved, making no meaningful progress on anything I cared about, research or writing or even exercise. Sometimes after failing over and over to catch a wave I lay face up on the surface of the ocean and wondered how I was still unable, for all the turning over of my undergraduate career in my head, to identify the single moment when I began to change for the worse. The arc I’d envisioned for the summer—the unearthing of some latent conviction I could latch onto as proof that 1) an upward trajectory existed for me and 2) I was plausibly traveling along it—was rapidly crumbling.</p><p>At dinner, Olivia kept asking me how my summer was going, and I kept deflecting. Finally I turned the question onto Rachel. It was my first time meeting her. Most of the early twenty-somethings I encountered didn’t feel like adults, but Rachel did. She adjusted her silver rings while she spoke. Her nails were painted an even, dark blue. The only makeup Rachel wore was mascara, not heavy, I could only tell because some of her lashes were still blond. She told me about the hundreds of pages of case law she read per day about farmer expropriation for her law internship. The South African government had promised to redistribute land to black farmers for the past thirty years. No one could get anything done past all the corruption and incompetence. She would try and piece together a new legal argument to put before the government—but many people had tried before, and she wasn’t hopeful about her success. Still: Rachel loved the work culture at her office; she had a five-year plan. When she asked about <em>my</em> work and cooed in wonder at the computer vision for ecology spiel I gave everyone, I felt like a grifter.</p><p>I knew Rachel seemed older to me because she was the first to pass the test I’d started silently deploying sometime after turning 21. Did the people around me fit the picture my seven-year-old self drew of a young adult? As it happened I had a concrete image to compare against. I spent my seventh year with my father in Senegal, the longest stretch of time I ever lived with him for. He hired a South African girl to take care of me. Justine, 21, from Johannesburg.</p><p>I’d been so excited for her arrival that I could not have failed to love her the moment I saw her, bent over next to her dresser adjusting her black tights. Mostly I felt overcome by relief that I no longer had to face my father alone when we watched movies or ate dinner together, that a happy, kind adult had stepped into the space between me and him. All my passwords from that time consisted of her full legal name plus some numbers. We learned a rudimentary amount of French together so I could communicate better in Senegal. Every night I brushed my teeth in her bathroom and said <em>bon nuit</em>—some kind of joke, I guess, about neither of us being good at French.</p><p>To me Justine was a total adult belonging in the same league as my mother or father, who may have played Cafe Life on Facebook with me and clambered over the rocky beach with me, but still was marked by a distance and maturity, a fundamental wholeness. Even when I found out she and my father, then in his mid-fifties, were sleeping together, I thought of the affair as shocking but not essentially perverted. It did not occur to me that she could feel emotions more complicated than contentment or sadness, or that she might have felt less than satisfied with her role as a human buffer between us. To me, the ideal adult—the teacher, the doctor—was, above all, <em>consistent</em>, and this made them easy to model to the point that I assumed of them a certain simplemindedness, a purity that became synonymous with adulthood. This wasn’t true for other children, who were often complicated, hypocritical, and wrong in obvious ways, bearing rough edges which I assumed time would smooth away.</p><p>This smoothing you can imagine in real time. I started doing it as a compulsion sometime in the past year and now when strangers pass through my vision I exaggerate any faint suggestion of awkwardness—an insecure slouch, a nervous flutter of eyelashes, a vestige of a once ill-proportioned face—to reduce them to youth; or I loosen their jowls, discolor their skin, and frump their figures to age them. Crucially this (anti-)aging process relies on making some crude assumption about their identities. How this Indian woman will present herself in thirty years, how this Kenyan man did thirty years ago.</p><p>Mostly it’s a fun game, but I’ve found I don’t know how to play it with myself. What lies beyond my twink death? It’s hard because all my strands of identity tangle together and refuse to straighten out into a coherent image. I kept thinking I’d grow out of being contradictory and messed up—that I’d <em>have</em> to, eventually, to enter the adult world. I thought, in fact, there was only one way it could happen, that time would funnel me into a narrower and narrower destiny. Once as a kid I visited a museum exhibit featuring a module that projected your face forward in time to show you what you’d look like in old age. The ghostly, wrinkled mask staring into space after that shitty 2010 software processed my low-res photo nevertheless looked enough like me that I was startled instantly into tears, faced at once with evidence that my future would contract around me, a sarcophagus closing on a form decided long ago.</p><p>At this point it’s more fantasy than expectation. When the bell tolls I bow down to spawn another version of myself, <em>The Substance</em>-style, who unzips the skin covering my spine from vertebrae thoracic to lumbar and steps out onto the floor shining wet and perfect. She lives a life full of success and admiration and reports back at night to drink my boiled bone marrow soup and tell me about her day. She gets along perfectly with her family and returns everyone’s calls and has squeezed every last drop of good fortune from her ancestors’ sweat and tears. You could imagine loving her for years, it’s easy, you could imagine her as girlfriend and wife and mother, she is what everyone has always wanted. I<em> </em>don’t think I want to live her life; but I want <em>someone</em> to, just so she exists, so she can make the people I love happy.</p><p>The issue is that she still needs a history, so let’s remember one. Before I was even a thought, she, as a toddler, lived in a village in the mountains of southern China with her grandmother. She played in the rice paddies, mostly alone. Her parents took care of her older sister in the city. She eventually moved back in with her parents, but her sister was prettier and smarter and better liked. She rode a bicycle to school, where she was quiet, an average student, decent with math and less than decent with language, having spent her formative years talking to almost no one.</p><p>When she was fifteen she came home more than once to her mother screaming trying to throw herself off the balcony while her father restrained her. One day her mother stabbed her through the hand with a butcher’s knife and she walked home from the family restaurant crying, her father following a few paces behind, their shadows thrown against the street by murky dusk. It bloomed then as it did for her mother at fifteen and her child at fifteen, that deep emptiness, and the dull recognition that life would go on anyway. In her last year of high school she rejected a boy in her class whom she’d liked up until he returned her affections. She got partway through an accounting degree. Then she met an American man twice her age in China on business.</p><p>At this point in the memory the scenes depart from the muted, diaphanous quality of Chinese cinema. Here are the sloping trees and spring blossoms and adolescents riding sepia-toned bicycles, and the incandescent interior of the restaurant at night. And there is the New Jersey-born man with a childhood of baseball over the radio and Grateful Dead mixtapes, sitting in a restaurant in Shenzhen bleary-eyed from travel. No matter how I spin this moment I can’t get it to work, having never witnessed a moment of civility, let alone chemistry, between them, but what I imagine is that back then she was still shy and he was not so stubborn, both softer versions of themselves. At the time they could barely converse. She got married at 24 when he brought her to America, and had a child the year after that.</p><p>My mother always wanted me to write a story about her life, but as she framed it, the story began with my birth. Everything she told me about her life before was only in justification, existing solely to prop mine up so I could experience the world on her behalf. Her primal dissatisfaction with her own passage through life, she felt, could have been remedied if only she could read and write and speak with the depth of an artist, could find consolation in something beyond the physical surface of the world, which was filled with pain and the impossibility of connection, the shameful hesitation when she had to read a passage aloud in class or was pressed in conversation by a friend. I can’t call to mind the memories of her reading to me, but she did, each night until I was four. And the hereditary blotches of flesh protruding from her cheekbones she excised from mine over several years when I was young, holding my head down, threading a sewing needle through the skin under my eyes. She wished her mother had done the same for her before they had the chance to take root, I heard her say past the sting of salt she applied afterwards. It’s true, now, that my skin is smooth, and that writing is all I have sometimes. It’s even true that I’m thankful.</p><p>What my mother wanted was not perfection—her standards were never so high—but continuity, consistency, purity. She accepted when things went wrong but wanted justice to be served, mistakes to be compensated for, the guilty party to accept blame and punishment. She fixated on ways to cleave the past away, beginning with <em>once we move out of his house I’ll be happy</em> and contorting in bitterness over a decade, upending her life year after year in search of cleanliness, separation, but finally settling into the sticky mold fate carved open for her: <em>once he dies I’ll be happy</em>. </p><p>I conceptualized adulthood as a kind of wholeness up until it came upon me and I saw the unique brokenness the passage of time inflicts. With time comes agency, the ability to make mistakes that you can no longer dismiss as the actions of a more naive, not yet fully formed being. Ironically, I used to imagine that the freedom of adulthood was what led to purity. The ability to become your own person, self-determined, detached from whatever came before. The ugly thing is that there is no way to cleave a part of your history away. Time’s arrow marches in one direction; mistakes only compound. The fantasy of spawning a perfect being is just that.</p><p>In that sense, the passage of time feels like nothing but an accumulation of dirt. Grime calcifying in grooves cobwebbed over skin. Sad memories of when I was younger, better, or at least cleaner. On that night in Cape Town staring at the sky with my wheel of nuts and silk elephant pants and Ernaux book, the passage of time felt instead like a sudden, physical vertigo. Those cleaner versions of myself stood with their necks craned back, too, and for a moment I felt their wonder. The night sky of the Southern hemisphere was unfamiliar to them. They did not know my path home from work. They had wronged fewer people, broken fewer promises; their love was a softer but more naive instrument. They could try and imagine their futures, and each might visualize a different curving, soaring path, a traipse through immaterial meadows that would leave no mark on the body.</p><p>In the wake of those younger, cleaner selves who thought they’d know by now who they were and what they wanted, I recoil from myself in repulsion. I think, <em>Who’s going to love me like this? </em>I’m not a woman or a man; not a child or an adult; not an animal or a human. Any purity I once had—any straightforwardness to my identity, any consistency, any wholeness—has been scraped away, and not cleanly. </p><p>I guess what makes me feel better is when I see someone I care for, I remember that I also don’t want to be loving the simple creature they sculpted from flesh and whittled down their bones to feed, whose future shines in a smooth arc towards heaven. Maybe once, I did want this. As a child, at 14, and 18, and for a while after, love was mostly about fulfilling expectation. I thought I had skipped all the stupid angsty parts. That was for kids, for horny teenagers, I’d skipped all the way to the real adult stuff, the stability and constancy. The picture I imagined of a married couple talking it out.</p><p>Now my experience of love has been sharpened to a painful point by hurting others and being hurt, now what I want is for the bitter parts of your history not to be erased but to be etched and held. What I want is for there to be more and more to you, so I could know you forever and still fail to replicate even a snapshot, so if you opened your back and a perfect version crawled out, it would be unrecognizable to me. What I want is the thrill of mystery, fingers moving over grooves too fine to count. What I want is to feel time passing in your arms before the sarcophagus clicks shut.</p><p>Now, when I am happiest, and when I am not worried about my housemates overhearing, I sing for hours while cleaning my room with my window open to a street I’ve come to know, sloping trees and spring blossoms and bicycles piled up against fence posts. She didn’t predict it would turn out this way, didn’t try as hard to pass on what she loved as she tried to scrub away the parts of history she hated, but you should know that—for as long as I can remember—when my mother is happiest, she sings for hours, too.</p>
