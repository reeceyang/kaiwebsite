      <h2>halfway there</h2>
      <span class="post-date">September 22, 2023</span>
      <div class="content">
      <p>Back to school now: my junior year of college. Lately things feel very fraught, balanced on the precipice between smooth sailing and disaster. I’ve had too many near misses—and straight-up misses—in my time here to feel confident in my ability to avert catastrophe anymore. If I’m not several days ahead of schedule, I’m panicking—which is an issue since I’m always several days <em>behind</em> schedule instead.</p><p>Still—halfway through college, I’ve learned some things about what works for me and what doesn’t. Things like: I need to go to lectures to stay on top of what I’m <em>supposed </em>to know for a class even if I technically know the lecture content, and so I feel some sense of accomplishment each day even if I’m struggling with my actual work; I need to get up early or I’ll sink into a pit of depression thinking about how I’m wasting my life because I woke up at 11 a.m.; I work best bouncing between different setups and locations from day to day, so things never start to feel stale and grey. (You might notice a pattern here in that most of what I do is motivated by digging my heels in against the gravitational pull of a depressive black hole, the constant, looming threat of an episode which will inevitably take my semester down with it.)</p><p>So here are some things I’ve done that have worked for me to keep myself happy and productive and, dare I say, vaguely fulfilled.</p><h3><strong>Mentorship</strong></h3><p>I was a mentor through the physics department during sophomore fall. I helped freshmen pass their physics classes or otherwise get more value and a deeper understanding out of them. In sophomore spring I chose to TA instead, which was a significantly lower quality experience since there’s much less of a one-on-one component. I felt like I had really developed relationships with my mentees—one of them even made me a knit bracelet as a gift at the end of the semester. Beyond this, having to meet with my mentees made me more disciplined with my time, and it was fun reviewing old physics material.</p><p>So this semester I’m mentoring again: three 8.01 freshmen. I’ve met with them already this week and I’m very excited to continue with them. Often I feel very strongly that I haven’t grown at all in my time at MIT, but then every time I talk with my mentees I’m reminded of how far apart we are in many metrics.</p><p>Not only that—I also signed up as a mentee in the same program! I’m taking 8.05, so a grad student in high energy physics is my mentor. We met to go over some pset questions I had, and it was so ridiculously relieving to have someone I could ask about these concepts whom I could trust not to look down on me for not fully understanding them.</p><p>So yes—not only giving but receiving mentorship this semester. Trying to train myself to receive help.</p><h3>Humanities</h3><p>I’m taking 22.04 (Social Problems of Nuclear Energy), which is a mildly intense humanities/writing-focused class. I have derived a <em>lot</em> of my joy in previous semesters from taking classes that required a lot of reading and writing, and I strongly felt the lack of this last semester. So I’m very happy about the amount of work this class is asking of me, and the high standards it holds its students to. </p><p>I think really good humanities classes force you to confront your preconceived notions and fuzzy approximations about a subject, and instead make your beliefs precise, your arguments succinct. When you come out the other end of a really good humanities class you should be able to talk about subjects with conviction and exactitude. That’s something I loved about my previous Chinese literature classes—taught by a professor with no tolerance for an imprecise statement—and something I appreciate about this class’s treatment of the feasibility of nuclear energy and of solutions to climate change.</p><h3>Making</h3><p>This is new! I’ve been very attracted to designing and building things for a long time, and I was excited to explore this more at MIT. Unfortunately I pretty much never got around to doing makerspace orientations so that I could use the equipment here. I’ve done a few small projects, like building my tortoise a wooden pen and doing basic carpentry for a theatre production; I also joined the solar car team and then the robotic boat team to try to get organized hands-on experience, but stopped doing both for various reasons.</p><p>It would be really sad if I left MIT without making some cool shit. Recently I saw my opportunity to squeeze into this nook on campus: the Hobby Shop, a wood- and metal-working makerspace previously on the MIT campus, had just relocated and reopened slightly off campus in a new, large space. They were offering orientations to new members; I signed up for one.</p><p>The nice thing about this space is that you have to make reservations to use the equipment, or to consult the guys working there about a project you want to build. So I make the reservation a couple days in advance and put it on my calendar, and then I have this chunk of time carved out for it. As my first project, I’m planning to make a basking dock for my turtles!</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>I claim that working out regularly this summer made some positive difference for my energy and confidence levels. Working out more makes me want to eat and drink more, which gives me more energy. And I actually enjoy the process of lifting weights (when it’s arm day, at least). I’m still not very strong, but I’m getting stronger. </p><p>Perhaps more important than any of these factors is the mental benefit of feeling like I’ve accomplished something after I get out of the gym. The objective fact that I have spent the past hour productively and that its benefits will stay with me.</p><p>There are plenty of other things I’m excited about for this semester, but these are the few I’ve been thinking about more recently. I haven’t blogged for a bit since I sort of fell out of the routine as I shifted back into Doing School so I just wanted to give an update, but I hope to return to my weekly rhythm now! </p>
