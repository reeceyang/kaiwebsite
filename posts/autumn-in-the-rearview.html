few days ago, I finished taking the last final of my junior fall. I’m free!</p><p>This semester was pretty awesome—objectively, and compared to previous semesters. I’m still waiting for some of my grades to be released, but I’m optimistic. And I feel happy.</p><p>This is crazy when you consider my track record in previous semesters! During my sophomore year, I dropped classes and got C’s or F’s left and right. I was routinely depressed for the second half of the semester. I cried nearly every day.</p><p>I can’t even tell you what’s changed. But here are some observations: I’m less tired and more able to maintain a consistent sleep schedule when I exercise regularly; I feel more eager to attend my lectures if I’ve been attending them without fail; I have more energy if I eat fuller meals. </p><p>Most of all, I’ve observed that the things I’m interested in learning aren’t necessarily the same as what other physics majors or math majors or nuclear engineering dabblers are interested in learning, and that’s fine. The class that got me out of bed every Monday and Wednesday was a humanities class—22.04, Nuclear Power and Society. It ended up being pretty technical and was a lot of work, to be sure, but it was still a humanities class. </p><p>I had always scorned the people who said things like “I’m interested in the intersection between technology and society~” because it seemed like a cop-out for not really being good at either thing. Now I guess I’m one of them, since I found out this semester that I am most excited by learning science when it feels real and relevant to the world. My 22.04 professor is also one of these people—he did his undergrad in physics and then got a PhD in international affairs—and I respect his intellect to the extent that his existence has finally convinced me of the legitimacy of ~science, technology, and society~ studies.</p><p>It’s also very exciting to <em>pursue</em> science that feels real and relevant to the world. I worked on a salmon counting project this semester, which I’ll continue at least until May. Basically, I trained and evaluated computer vision models to detect and track salmon in sonar videos of rivers in the Pacific Northwest and in Alaska. I learned a lot about the command line, ML workflows, and consistently making time for research during the semester. It didn’t really have anything to do with physics at all. But being able to count salmon quickly and accurately is an important problem, and I’m happy that I am helping to solve it.</p><p>I spoke a bit about what I’m doing this semester in a <a href="https://goldenblue.substack.com/p/halfway-there">previous post</a>, but I’d like to reflect on how they turned out.</p><h3>Classes</h3><ol><li><p><strong>22.04, Nuclear Power and Society</strong>: as previously mentioned, my favorite class this semester, probably my favorite class at MIT so far? The basic question the class aimed to answer was whether building more nuclear power is beneficial to society. (I’m much less convinced now of the affirmative than I was before the semester began!) The professor was awesome, the entire class was awesome, and for the final few weeks, I put a lot of work into a final project that was very satisfying for me—it investigated whether using nuclear energy to power hydrogen production through high-temperature steam electrolysis was economically feasible. This class was legitimately life-changing and made me think about my intake of information and the opinions I hold in a very different light than before. It also caused me to totally reconsider my career path and life in general.</p></li><li><p><strong>8.05, Quantum Mechanics II</strong>: I don’t have my final grade in this class yet and won’t until after the holidays, but I feel almost certain that I passed, and I think it’s plausible I got a B. I’m very happy about this since I failed the class in the spring and I feel I gained a much deeper understanding of quantum mechanics by taking it once more!</p></li><li><p><strong>8.09, Classical Mechanics III</strong>: This class singlehandedly revived my love for physics after a solid spring semester of thinking I should switch my major. It was the first class I’ve consistently attended office hours and recitations for, and it paid off a lot in my understanding of the material. It covered a lot of ground: Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics, perturbation theory, fluid mechanics, and nonlinear dynamics. Learning about phenomena I could directly observe in my day-to-day life was very satisfying, a nice change from 8.05. And this class forced me to learn to use Mathematica, which has probably been a net positive?</p></li><li><p><strong>8.231, Physics of Solids</strong>: I dropped 18.112 (Complex Analysis) to take this class instead. This was mostly because the 18.112 professor seemed somewhat disorganized and confused, even though he was very nice as a person, and the 8.231 lectures, which I enjoyed much more, conflicted with 18.112 lectures. The class was not too rigorous—it presented many concepts using only an intuitive explanation, without proof; and the psets were never very long—but it was a great introduction to solid state physics. I have been vaguely interested in this subject for a while and now I feel satisfied with what I know about it.</p></li><li><p>I also took a somewhat trivial 6-unit class which was required alongside my research. Mostly, some speakers came in and talked about their work in climate and sustainability, and then we discussed amongst ourselves.</p></li></ol><h3>Mentorship</h3><p>I acted as a physics mentor for three first-year students taking 8.01 (Physics 1, a required intro physics class). This was generally enjoyable; two of my students passed the class with flying colors, and I’m not sure about the third one, who kind of ghosted me near the end. I didn’t really know how to help her, since many of her issues with the class seemed to stem from larger problems like having difficulty paying attention or managing time. I think I became a little better at mentorship, but I had forgotten how stressful it was for me—I went home with a splitting headache after each meeting, even though my mentees were all really cool and nice. Because of this, I probably won’t continue to mentor in the spring semester.</p><p>I was also mentored in 8.05 by a nice grad student. This significantly helped reduce my stress about the class, since I had someone I could check in with about my progress every week and to whom I could just complain about things. Often I would use his presence as a sanity check for my understanding of a concept, and he could help correct small mistakes, something that ended up being immensely helpful but that I would never bother a TA in office hours about. I wish there were mentorship programs for higher-level physics courses—8.05 is the last one you can sign up for a mentor in—but I guess that’s supposed to be what upperclassmen are for.</p><h3>Other Stuff</h3><p>Using the makerspaces more was a big thing I was excited for, but I didn’t follow through with the projects I had planned because the semester got too busy. I hope to finish the turtle basking dock over IAP, though!</p><p>I also continued working out (mostly) regularly this semester and even took an ice skating class in the second quarter. I ice skated a few times over the summer and really enjoyed it; the class helped me get in more practice and push myself to learn things like skating backwards, smoother crossovers, and transitions between forward and backward skating. I’m planning to take intermediate ice skating in the spring if my schedule allows.</p><h3>The Future</h3><p>This IAP, I’ll be taking a 6-unit probability class and working on a project with my 22.04 professor; I won’t say too much about it here, mainly because I don’t know the project details very well yet. I’ll be in the office every day, on the 6th floor of a building where bright light shines in and there is a little coffee machine and a little teapot, with my project mentor in the same room. I’m overjoyed that I have this opportunity.</p><p>I’ve also decided I need to see some more of the world before getting a PhD, which entails getting a job out of college. Next semester’s course selections are, in part, motivated by this: I’m taking 8.13: J-Lab, a really intense 18-unit lab class, because everyone wants physicists who can do data analysis and use oscilloscopes; 6.200: Circuits and Electronics, because everyone wants physicists who can build and understand circuits; and 8.421: Atomic and Optical Physics, because everyone wants physicists who understand irradiating stuff, but mostly because Wolfgang Ketterle is teaching it.</p><p>It feels more this semester like I’m coming into my own, finding paths that suit me. Some things I’d like to change: I’m still dissatisfied by how little I create during the semester, the fact that my art and writing are essentially on pause while I study physics; I want to exercise and eat more; I’d like to develop closer friendships with some people I care about. We’ll see how this goes.</p>
