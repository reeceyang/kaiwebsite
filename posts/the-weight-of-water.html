      <h2>the weight of water</h2>
      <span class="post-date">July 25, 2021</span>
      <div class="content">
      <p>I began swimming regularly this summer—first because I got a job as a swim instructor and was worried that my technique had degraded since the last time I swam, and second because I wanted to improve my fitness. This second desire has been a point of contention for a very long time. For as long as I can remember I have been frustrated by my own lack of strength. Being physically weak is the worst feeling in the world to me. It’s not like a homework assignment you can’t do, where even if you have never seen a problem before, you can look it up, you can learn the thought process, you can ask for hints from those more experienced than you.</p><p>When there is something you can’t physically do, there is no such thing as a hint—either you can do it or you cannot. In high school my friends and family would lightheartedly make fun of me, pin my wrist down to the table using only half their strength and laugh at how I couldn’t pry it free no matter how hard I tried, joke about me needing protection; I’d laugh along with them, because it was a silly thing to get mad over, but I was mad over it. It made me feel powerless.</p><p>When COVID hit, I resolved to become fit, once and for all. I dusted off my mom’s five-pound dumbbells and downloaded the Nike fitness app, and for a while, I was really consistent with it. I liked the post-exercise feeling, I liked the feeling of expending a lot of effort and accomplishing something—finishing my favorite 15-minute workout without breaks, finally being able to do a certain lift that had proved impossible before, watching the number of minutes I had exercised tick up on the app.</p><p>But it was also really frustrating. I was as scrawny at the end of the two-month period that I used the app for as I had been at the beginning. Even though it felt like I had improved (and even though I’d graduated to eight-pound dumbbells now, go me), in photos I looked exactly the same.</p><p>It was especially frustrating that my work ethic, which I applied to academics without fail, didn’t seem to help me at all here. When I’m studying, improvement might not be easy, but it’s familiar—I’ve done physics for long enough now that I have seen how progress accumulates over the course of a year, how days filled with little failures add up to enormous growth over time.</p><p>Working out is worlds away from that. I’d ask my friends every other week: when will I see progress? And they’d tell me: be consistent, keep at it, you’ll build muscle. But it’s really discouraging. The feeling of not being able to lift something, having to admit that you can’t do it, and watching your friend step in and lift that same thing effortlessly. You have to just accept that there are some things you can’t do yet, and you have to trust that if you do this same workout routine for six more months, there will be a somewhat higher chance of you being able to do the thing.</p><p>I dropped the dumbbells. But I am swimming now! I don’t know if swimming for three hours a week makes you much stronger, but it’s definitely increased my stamina and improved my breath control. I still hate it when the person in the lane next to me swims faster than I do; I’m still embarrassed even getting into the pool, with how skinny I am and how slowly I swim.</p><p>But I remind myself that, in a way, science was like this too—my struggle learning physics was like this too. You suck at something, and you do it over and over, and slowly, very slowly, you get better.</p><p>Learning physics was also nothing like this, though. Because I could always trust that in the time between me sitting down at my desk and standing up again, I would solve a problem, or I would refresh a concept, or at the very least I would identify a weakness to work on. But now, I get in the pool, and I swim my mile, and it takes me the amount of time that swimswam dot com says it should take a “beginner swimmer” even though I’ve known how to swim for as long as I’ve known how to walk, and I get out of the pool having gained nothing but the weight of water.</p><p>Despite all this—I’m a regular at the pool now. The attendants just let me in; they don’t even ask for my pass. Sometimes one of the lifeguards, I don’t know his name but he looks a little older than me and swims about twice as fast, gives me advice. I like the smell of the chlorine. On the days that I can’t make it to swim, I feel disappointed; when it’s time to leave the pool, I feel disappointed too. So sometimes I think that I should chill out. Not everything is about how good I am at something. Some things are just about enjoying the weight of the water on your skin, and trusting that growth will follow.</p>
