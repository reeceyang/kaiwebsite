      <h2>closeness / proximity</h2>
      <span class="post-date">July 01, 2022</span>
      <div class="content">
      <p>I try to be a social person. Everyone talks about the people being the best part of MIT, and entering my freshman year, I was also looking forward to the magic of meeting other MIT students, learning from them, living with them.</p><p>In hindsight, maybe these expectations doomed me to disappointment. Socializing has always been hard for me. Rationally, I don’t think I’m that bad at it; interactions with other people are just taxing in a way that nothing else really is for me. The tremendous anxiety leading up to a social interaction, the constant effort and tension throughout, the sheer exhaustion that hits afterwards – it gets better the more comfortable I am with someone, but it rarely ever goes away.</p><p>The thing is that I like spending time with people I care about. It’s just that I have a finite amount of energy for it, and communal living at MIT stretches it thin – being around people all the time, always making small talk in hallways or saying hi on the way to the bathroom, having to smile and converse even while I’m studying or cooking dinner. It’s like, you interact with people all day in classes, and then you interact with people for the rest of the time, too.</p><p>This would not normally have sounded pleasant to high school me, but I thought that because it was MIT, and you “find your people” at MIT, I would simply morph into a socially adept, energetic extrovert upon stepping foot in my dorm for the first time. Finally, people I would click with instantly!</p><p>But in Boston I felt like the same person I had been in LA, despite my best efforts to change. Everything I’d read and heard about MIT from the blogs, the Discord, and CP* made me feel like I had to socialize more, that something was wrong if I didn’t find a community I loved immediately…or ever. I thought to myself,&nbsp;<em>give it time</em>, and I gave it a whole year of time: joining a learning community (Terrascope), trying to integrate myself into SEVT for more than half the year before I finally quit, going to the social events that my floor went to, seeking out friends to pset with even if I didn’t need the pset help, trying to say yes to every social invitation.</p><p>And some of these things were worthwhile and enjoyable! I loved being with other people from Terrascope. I made friends through psetting. I became closer with some people that I’m looking forward to hanging out with more in the future.</p><p>But most of the social things I tried this year ended up not being right for me. And I wish I had given myself permission earlier to stop trying so hard. I felt bad about not enjoying my living community or the clubs I was doing enough, and thought that the solution must be to do more, because MIT is so often portrayed as a place where you’ll find your community no matter what. Dorm culture (especially within EC) is exalted, and taking time away from classes to do more extracurriculars and hang out with friends more is encouraged, because that makes lots of people happier! So if this wasn’t true for me, I must simply be doing something wrong.</p><p>I moved to tEp for the summer and for the foreseeable future, like I mentioned in previous posts. I’ve enjoyed the community more, but I still find myself very tired. It’s pretty frustrating: even though I enjoy all my social interactions individually, as a whole they just make me feel burnt out. I have some hope that this will improve as I spend more time in the house, but I also don’t want to repeat the mistakes of freshman year, holding onto things that don’t make me happy because I feel like they should make me happy.</p><p>Recently I visited Amherst with my girlfriend to see one of her friends doing research at UMass. This trip was a tipping point for me.</p><p>In Amherst I tried very hard to engage in the same activities that my partner’s friend group did, and I just didn’t enjoy them. Things were too much and too loud, I felt on edge the entire time trying to hold conversations with people I didn’t know, and I felt exhausted at the end of each day. At some point I was so tired of social interaction that the mere memory of a positive social interaction I’d had filled me with a sense of anxiety and dread.</p><p>This led to a realization: I’ve been trying for years to increase my social bandwidth, but at some point I just need to accept that, compared to other people, I have less capacity for social interactions while staying happy, energetic, and able to contribute my all to friendships.</p><p>There were a few bright spots in the trip to Amherst. We swam in a pond together and jumped off a rope swing. We also attended a dinner party at a friend’s off-campus apartment. It was rented by just two people, but it was beautiful, and as the night progressed I found myself feeling more and more amiable to something like an apartment of my own, a space that could be wholly mine.</p><p>Thus enters another realization: the solution to my social woes is probably not to get dinner with friends less often, or to stop psetting with people, or to leave Terrascope. The best solution is probably to decrease background interactions that are less intentional, less valuable, yet happen far more frequently – and the best way to do that is to live by myself. I think that this way, I’ll be able to enjoy the interactions I care about more, and I’ll be able to put much more energy into developing friendships if I’m not constantly feeling like I’m recovering from the last social interaction I had.</p><p>So yeah. This was a really long-winded way of writing out my thoughts about maybe getting an apartment for myself and my girlfriend in the future – maybe junior year. Of course there are some potential cons to this. In particular, I’d be more distant from the MIT community, and it might be harder to be involved with on-campus clubs and events. But living in tEp this next year will give me a valuable trial run; I’ll be able to weigh these considerations more realistically as the year goes on, and hopefully by midyear I’ll have a good idea of whether an apartment would be better for me.</p>
